                        I like to do, to see,
                        and
                        to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to
                        talk, I
                        like
                        to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I
                        like to
                        feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to
                        look at
                        the
                        clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the
                        middle
                        of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter.
